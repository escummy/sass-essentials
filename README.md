## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy on a live system and clone the repository.

<br>

- (Option 1): Clone the repository with link "https"

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/escummy/tmdb-posters-api.git
```

- (Option 2): Clone the repository with link "SSH"

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:escummy/tmdb-posters-api.git
```

- (Option 3): Download the file.zip to your desktop

<br>

### # Prerequisites

To continue, you need to have installed: `Node`

<br>

(Check in your terminal bash)

```
node --version
```

<br>

Else, Install nodejs from the official site 'version LTS' (Recommended)

[English] - https://nodejs.org/en/ (or) [Spanish] - https://nodejs.org/es/

<br>

## Installing dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies and devDependencies from any package.json

```bash
  npm install
```

<br>

## Available scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm run dev
```

> Runs the app in the development mode.\
> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
> > The page will reload if you make edits.\
> > You will also see any lint errors in the console.

<br>

## To run tests

Start checking tests with the following command, which will open a debug console and UI interface in the browser to help with the testing process.

```
npm test
````

<br>

## To build in prodcution

Builds the app for production to the `build` or `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

> The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
> Your app is ready to be deployed.
> > This VITE react project build and deploy following [Vite guidelines](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

<br>

```
npm run build
````

<br>

## To run a preview

This is one-way to check the project in the browser using the production build folder.

<br>

```
npm run preview
```

<br>

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [npm create vite@latest](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#testing-the-app-locally),  check documentation for static deploy or babel usage.

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
